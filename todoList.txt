Be able to select what time you want

Adding Selected Addrs:
    Make the add button look better
    To Remove the addr make it a font-awesome tag
    When addr removed from list make the one next to it the selected one
    If the user puts an invalid addr make it so that an alert pops up
    The first Addr in the list will be the one selected if removed 
    Theres a limited amount of colors to choose from so when the user hits a limit in addrs dont let them add more
    Make a warning
Compare:
    remove the need for a selected addr
    Average profit-balance in a day calculate
    Compare BTC day 
    Add a little toggler on the top to compare Payments, workers, and profit
    Make it work. If I add the cycle() on created it works but there are duplicates. CHekc for duplicaiton or find another way to do it

Payments:
    calculate profit, Set it up like profti X Current BIT Price  = $, at hover gor Current be able to add a slider and change it 
    Return all payments not just the ones provide<Currently 7>
    There should be a red and blue colors to indicate profit 
    Make it stacked so the ones in the bottom are red and indicate fee
